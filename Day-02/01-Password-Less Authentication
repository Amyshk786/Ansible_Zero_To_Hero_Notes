================================================================================


For Password Less Authentication got to the GitHub Repo and follow the steps.




There is a way that has to be there for Ansible to know what are its manage nodes and that process is called as Ansible inventory actually it's just a file so you just provide Ansible a file and within the file you just put the name of your manage notes name is nothing but the user as well as the IP address now the Ansible inventory can be written in two formats initially when Ansible was uh incepted the only way of doing it is using the inventory.ini file but now you can also put the inventory in the YAML file format but the most popular approach is the inventory.ini file what is inventory.ini file don't worry ini is just an extension.

# How to setup Password-less Authentication

## EC2 Instances

### Using Public Key

```
ssh-copy-id -f "-o IdentityFile <PATH TO PEM FILE>" ubuntu@<INSTANCE-PUBLIC-IP>
```

- ssh-copy-id: This is the command used to copy your public key to a remote machine.
- -f: This flag forces the copying of keys, which can be useful if you have keys already set up and want to overwrite them.
- "-o IdentityFile <PATH TO PEM FILE>": This option specifies the identity file (private key) to use for the connection. The -o flag passes this option to the underlying ssh command.
- ubuntu@<INSTANCE-IP>: This is the username (ubuntu) and the IP address of the remote server you want to access.

### Using Password 

- Go to the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/60-cloudimg-settings.conf`
- Update `PasswordAuthentication yes`
- Restart SSH -> `sudo systemctl restart ssh`
